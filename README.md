# Resources
I only used module six to walk me through this assignment, along with the [HTML5 boilerplate resource](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/src/css/main.css#L107-L169). I got stuck trying to get the logo and nav on the same line so I did some Googling but found Stack Overflow to be pretty useless. It did not help me. 

# Deductions
I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

# Comments
Any feedback on how to fix the navigation? Thank you!
